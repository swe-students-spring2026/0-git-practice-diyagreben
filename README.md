**Why I found this article interesting**
Firstly, I found it interesting that only 11% of organizations have agents in production.  Based on tech trends of 2025, and my own experience in a corporate environment, I expected this number to be much higher. In addition, the article states that Gartner predicts 40% of agentic projects will fail by 2027. The reason given was because organizations are prioritizing automating broken processes instead of redesigning operations. In my opinion, I disagreee. Not all automated processes are inherently broken. For example, take an HR Chatbot agent designed to answer quick and simple HR questions from the company's employees. The process of getting HR answers isn't inherently broken, but an automated agent designed to answer these questions makes the process much faster and easier for employees. That is to say, HR employees are still needed,as the HR chatbot still needs information and data to base its information off of. The HR process does not need a redesign, just a little bit of assistance and speed.

## Hanlin's Comment:
I found this article interesting because it points out the unrealisitic fast expansion of AI and the pivot in 2026 becomes how to make an impact and deployment. I agree with the survey and main takeaways and I think Success will go to organizations that adapt fast, govern responsibly, and integrate technology at scale into business strategy.
